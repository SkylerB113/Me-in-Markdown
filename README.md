## Introduction
Hello, my name is Skyler! I am 17 years old and I am a senior here at Chatsworth. This is of course my second year of taking a computer science class (and actually my second time being with Mr. Aiello!) and so far it has been very fun. I am also a cheerleader and have been on Chatsworth's team since my sophomore year! I also have a brother who is going to be attending UC Irvine in the fall for engineering, and a brown tabby cat named Barnaby whom I both love dearly. Some of my hobbies include art, playing guitar, going shopping, attending concerts, DIY-ing everything, and more. I have been playing guitar for about 5 years but I would not say I'm any good at it compared to most guitarists. My dream is to be able to play some cool guitar tracks and eventually own a white Les Paul. A recent art project that I have done that I am extremely proud of is I made and sewed my own patches onto my backpack for senior year. Along with this I thorougly enjoy movies and music, specifically horror movies and rock/metal music. My absolute favourite horror movies are the Saw franchise. I have watched all 10 movies, some of them even up to three times! I would consider Saw II to be my favourite overall, with the first and tenth being close seconds. Finally, my goals after high school is to attend Pierce College and then transfer to Irvine after a few years like my brother, and then study to pursue a career in forensic science. I am excited for what my final year of high school will bring me and I hopefully will make many fond memories.

## My-Music
I absolutely love music; it has practically built my personality my whole life. I have seen over 50 people in concert over the pas 4/5 years and I don't plan on stopping. Here are some songs that I enjoy!
