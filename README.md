Hello, my name is Skyler! I am 17 years old and I am a senior here at Chatsworth. This is of course my second year of taking a computer science class and so far it has been fun. Some of my hobbies include art, playing guitar, going shopping DIY-ing everything, and more. I thorougly enjoy movies and music, specifically horror movies and rock/metal music.
