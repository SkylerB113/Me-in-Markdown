## Introduction
Hello, my name is Skyler! I am 17 years old and I am a senior here at Chatsworth. This is of course my second year of taking a computer science class (and actually my second time being with Mr. Aiello!) and so far it has been very fun. I am also a cheerleader and have been on Chatsworth's team since my sophomore year! I also have a brother who is going to be attending UC Irvine in the fall for engineering, and a brown tabby cat named Barnaby whom I both love dearly. Some of my hobbies include art, playing guitar, going shopping, attending concerts, DIY-ing everything, and more. I have been playing guitar for about 5 years but I would not say I'm any good at it compared to most guitarists. My dream is to be able to play some cool guitar tracks and eventually own a white Les Paul. A recent art project that I have done that I am extremely proud of is I made and sewed my own patches onto my backpack for senior year. Along with this I thorougly enjoy movies and music, specifically horror movies and rock/metal music. My absolute favourite horror movies are the Saw franchise. I have watched all 10 movies, some of them even up to three times! I would consider Saw II to be my favourite overall, with the first and tenth being close seconds. Finally, my goals after high school is to attend Pierce College and then transfer to Irvine after a few years like my brother, and then study to pursue a career in forensic science. I am excited for what my final year of high school will bring me and I hopefully will make many fond memories.

## My-Music
I absolutely love music; it has practically built my personality my whole life. I have seen over 50 people in concert over the pas 4/5 years and I don't plan on stopping. Here are some songs that I enjoy!

### "The Sky Under the Sea" - Pierce The Veil
I of course had to start off with Pierce The Veil. Pierce The Veil is my favourite band of all time (I had the blessing of seeing them live on July 1st!) "The Sky Under the Sea" is the final track that comes off their record *Selfish Machines*, which is also my favourite album by them. I love the way Pierce The Veil is able to dramaticize feelings of love and heartbreak in their songs. This one is a great example of it. I would totally recommend giving it a listen if you are into any emo or rock music! I also recommend songs like "Yeah Boy and Doll Face", "Tangled in the Great Escape", and "The Boy Who Could Fly"!

### "Out Of Control" - She Wants Revenge
She Wants Revenge is my favourite goth/darkwave band. They are fairly new to me as I only really started listening to more of them last year. Their music very catchy and I would play it if I was hosting a goth club. I find Warfield(the lead singer)'s voice very unique and appealing! Their song "Tear You Apart" was trending online a while ago so their sound might be familiar. "Out Of Control" is definitely one of my favourites.

### "The Ghost of You" - My Chemical Romance
I have been listening to My Chemical Romance for nearly 6 years now and they are such a loved and significant band in my life. "The Ghost of You" comes off their album *Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge*, my favourite album from them for many reasons. I just absolutely love the songs and cover art. The album also has a storyline to it: it follows a man who was killed along with his lover. He makes a deal with the devil that in order to see his lover again, he needs to kill 1,000 evil men, the last one ultimately being himself. Fun fact, this is one of the first songs I ever learned how to play on guitar!

### "Sound Effects and Overdramatics" - The Used
I discovered The Used about 3 1/2 years ago and instantly adored their sound. "Sound Effects and Overdramatics" is my favourite song by them. I recently discovered it was in Saw II which made me love it even more, it was like two of my favourite things combined! I've seen The Used live 3 times now over the years. The most recent concert I went to was on May 10th at The Wiltern when my boyfriend took me. They were playing one of their albums in full for 3 nights and we went to the night when they played *In Love and Death*. I got to hear this song live! It was an amazing experience. I definitely recommend this song if you like the type of music I do.

### "Get Crunk" - Brokencyde
This song is kind of random but I just had to put it in here. Brokencyde makes scene music and they are definitely not for everyone, but I do enjoy listening to them a lot ("I'm Not a Fan But the Kids Like It" as their album would say :) ) The lyrics are sometimes hard to understand, but I would be lying if I said they weren't catchy! This is my favourite song by them. For the longest time it was their song "Scene Girlz", which initially got me interested in the band. If they are your vibe I would check them out along with other scene bands like 3OH!3 and Millionaires!

### "Borderline Stalker" - Signal The Escape
I just discovered Signal The Escape earlier this year! They are a realy small emo/post-hardcore band with only a little less than 37,000 monthly listeners on Spotify. I would have loved to see them live but unfortunately they do not make music anymore :(. "Borderline Stalker" is a song that I interpret as a love story built on obsession. The narrator appears to be obsessed with the other person but feelings aren't being reciprocated. The narrator turns to metaphorically stalking the other person, using metaphors like a knife to the throat and them looking at someone else to show the other person's disinterest. I absolutely love how I discovered this band and now I would like to share them!

### "If I'm James Dean, You're Audrey Hepburn" - Sleeping With Sirens
Sleeping With Sirens is another emo/rock band from Orlando, Florida that I like. I associate them a lot with Pierce The Veil since they were an opener at the concert and the lead singer, Kellin Quinn, was featured on the song "King For A Day". I also got to see this song live at the show. The intro makes me go absolutely insane; there's no buildup before the vocals which makes it so cool! It's a running joke that Kellin is actually a biological girl since his voice is so high pitched. I would love to be able to sing like him but unfortunately I just can't do that. "If I'm James Dean, You're Audrey Hepburn" is definitely one of the greatest Sleeping With Sirens songs written. I love it!

### "Purity" - Slipknot
It was a little hard choosing a Slipknot song for this playlist but I found this one most interesting to talk about. The story behind this song is that Corey Taylor, the singer, read a story online that he believed was real. It told the story of a girl named Adrianne Purity Knight who was kidnapped and buried alive. The author of the story later claimed it was fictional and tried to file a lawsuit against Slipknot. This led to the song being removed off their debut album but was later added on the 10-year anniversary edition of it. I would say it isn't a really popular Slipknot song but is totally worth the listen, along with their other more "niche" songs.

### "You've Seen the Butcher" - Deftones
I listen to many Deftones songs and this so far is my favourite! "You've Seen the Butcher" comes off their album *Diamond Eyes* released in 2010.
